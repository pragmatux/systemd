REQUIREMENTS:
        Linux kernel >= 2.6.39
          CONFIG_DEVTMPFS
          CONFIG_CGROUPS (it's OK to disable all controllers)
          CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER
          CONFIG_SIGNALFD
          CONFIG_TIMERFD
          CONFIG_EPOLL
          CONFIG_NET
          CONFIG_SYSFS

        Linux kernel >= 3.8 for Smack support

        Udev will fail to work with the legacy layout:
          CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=n

        Legacy hotplug slows down the system and confuses udev:
          CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH=""

        Userspace firmware loading is deprecated, will go away, and
        sometimes causes problems:
          CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER=n

        Some udev rules and virtualization detection relies on it:
          CONFIG_DMIID

        Mount and bind mount handling might require it:
          CONFIG_FHANDLE

        Optional but strongly recommended:
          CONFIG_IPV6
          CONFIG_AUTOFS4_FS
          CONFIG_TMPFS_POSIX_ACL
          CONFIG_TMPFS_XATTR
          CONFIG_SECCOMP

        For systemd-bootchart a kernel with procfs support and several
        proc output options enabled is required:
          CONFIG_PROC_FS
          CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS
          CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG

        For UEFI systems:
          CONFIG_EFI_VARS
          CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION

        dbus >= 1.4.0
        libcap
        libblkid >= 2.20 (from util-linux) (optional)
        libkmod >= 5 (optional)
        PAM >= 1.1.2 (optional)
        libcryptsetup (optional)
        libaudit (optional)
        libacl (optional)
        libattr (optional)
        libselinux (optional)
        liblzma (optional)
        tcpwrappers (optional)
        libgcrypt (optional)
        libqrencode (optional)
        libmicrohttpd (optional)
        libpython (optional)
        make, gcc, and similar tools

        During runtime you need the following additional dependencies:

        util-linux >= v2.19 (requires fsck -l, agetty -s)
        sulogin (from util-linux >= 2.22 or sysvinit-tools, optional but recommended)
        dracut (optional)
        PolicyKit (optional)

        When building from git you need the following additional dependencies:

        docbook-xsl
        xsltproc
        automake
        autoconf
        libtool
        intltool
        gperf
        gtkdocize (optional)
        python (optional)
        sphinx (optional)
        python-lxml (entirely optional)

        When systemd-hostnamed is used it is strongly recommended to
        install nss-myhostname to ensure that in a world of
        dynamically changing hostnames the hostname stays resolvable
        under all circumstances. In fact, systemd-hostnamed will warn
        if nss-myhostname is not installed.

        Note that D-Bus can link against libsystemd-login.so, which
        results in a cyclic build dependency. To accommodate for this
        please build D-Bus without systemd first, then build systemd,
        then rebuild D-Bus with systemd support.

        To build HTML documentation for python-systemd using sphinx,
        please first install systemd (using 'make install'), and then
        invoke sphinx-build with 'make sphinx-<target>', with <target>
        being 'html' or 'latexpdf'. If using DESTDIR for installation,
        pass the same DESTDIR to 'make sphinx-html' invocation.

USERS AND GROUPS:
        Default udev rules use the following standard system group
        names, which need to be resolvable by getgrnam() at any time,
        even in the very early boot stages, where no other databases
        and network are available:

        tty, dialout, kmem, video, audio, lp, floppy, cdrom, tape, disk

        During runtime the journal daemon requires the
        "systemd-journal" system group to exist. New journal files will
        be readable by this group (but not writable) which may be used
        to grant specific users read access.

        It is also recommended to grant read access to all journal
        files to the system groups "wheel" and "adm" with a command
        like the following in the post installation script of the
        package:

        # setfacl -nm g:wheel:rx,d:g:wheel:rx,g:adm:rx,d:g:adm:rx /var/log/journal/

        The journal gateway daemon requires the
        "systemd-journal-gateway" system user and group to
        exist. During execution this network facing service will drop
        privileges and assume this uid/gid for security reasons.

WARNINGS:
        systemd will warn you during boot if /etc/mtab is not a
        symlink to /proc/mounts. Please ensure that /etc/mtab is a
        proper symlink.

        systemd will warn you during boot if /usr is on a different
        file system than /. While in systemd itself very little will
        break if /usr is on a separate partition many of its
        dependencies very likely will break sooner or later in one
        form or another. For example udev rules tend to refer to
        binaries in /usr, binaries that link to libraries in /usr or
        binaries that refer to data files in /usr. Since these
        breakages are not always directly visible systemd will warn
        about this, since this kind of file system setup is not really
        supported anymore by the basic set of Linux OS components.

        For more information on this issue consult
        http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/separate-usr-is-broken

        To run systemd under valgrind, compile with VALGRIND defined
        (e.g. ./configure CPPFLAGS='... -DVALGRIND=1'). Otherwise,
        false positives will be triggered by code which violates
        some rules but is actually safe.
